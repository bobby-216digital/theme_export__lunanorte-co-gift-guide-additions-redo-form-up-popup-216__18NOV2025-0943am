Tourmaline is hardly ever colorless. Its different colors are due to various minerals being present within the stone— iron creates blue, black, and brown tourmaline, where magnesium creates yellow and brown, and lithium creates virtually any color. Tourmaline can even come in a ‘watermelon’ color, forming a red or pink core surrounded by green caused by a change in the chemistry of a geothermal fluid creating the stone. It is also often found in “bi-colored” or “tri-colored” crystals where more than one color is found in the crystal.
